# Geocaching Classic App Exporter
Exports lists and waypoints from the Geocaching Classic App

This app will read the classic Geocaching App data from an unencrypted iTunes backup and will export waypoints and lists to geocaching.com. This is currently only compatable with the iOS version of the classic app. I am exploring the possibility of making an Android compatable version.

To install:
* On Windows, unzip the installer and run setup.exe
* On MacOS, unzip the application and copy to your applications directory

To use this, you must first back up your device to your computer using iTunes. For instructions, visit https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HhV8kVIDjj0ed56p_2zSV5GE9rF6EtljzJ9tjQpvtrU/edit?usp=sharing
